Australiaâ€™s national statistical agency, providing trusted official statistics
on a wide range of economic, social, population and environmental matters of

  * Consumer Price Index (CPI)
  * Labour Force
  * Population trends


The [Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)](http://www.rba.gov.au/) is Australia's
central bank. In addition to its legislative responsibilities, it collects and
publishes statistics on money, credit, the Australian banking systems and other
relevant economic metrics. Key RBA statistics include:

  * Banking system assets and liabilities
  * Money and credit statistics
  * Household and business finances
  * Interest rates
  * Exchange rates
  * Inflation and inflation expectations.


The ABS and RBA make their statistics primarily available through Excel and/or
CSV spreadsheets. 


This package provides functions to search and download data and statistics from
the [Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](http://www.abs.gov.au/) and [Reserve
Bank of Australia (RBA)](http://www.rba.gov.au/) websites, as well as draft
